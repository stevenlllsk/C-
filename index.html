    <h1 id="chapter1-1" class="chapter">Chapter 1.1: Statements and structure of a program</h1>
    <h1>Statements:</h1>
    <p>A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tells the computer what to do.
        A statement is a type of instruction that tells the program to perform some action. 
        Statements are the most common type of instruction in a C++ program because they are the smallest 
        independent unit of computation in C++, so they function like sentences in natural language.    
    <p>When we talk or convey an idea 
        to another person, we typically speak or write in sentences, so in C++, we write in 
        statements instead. Almost all (not always) statements will 
        end in a semicolon. In C++, a single statement could compile into many Machine Language Instructions</p>
    <h1>The different types of statements:</h1>
    <p>• Declaration statements</p>
    <p>• Jump statements</p>
    <p>• Expression statements</p>
    <p>• Compound statements</p>
    <p>• Selection statements (conditionals)</p>
    <p>• Iteration statements (loops)</p>
    <p>• Try blocks</p>
    <h1>Functions and Main Functions:</h1>
    <p>In C++, statements are grouped into units called functions. 
        A function is a collection of statements executed 
        sequentially (in order). When you learn more, you will be able 
        to create some pretty awesome functions.</p>
    <div class="rule-box">
        <h1>Rule</h1>
        <p>Every function must have a special function named main (all lowercase). 
            When the program is compiled and run, the statements inside main are run 
            in sequential order.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Programs usually terminate after running after the last statement inside 
        the function main has been executed. (Though due to bugs or mistakes, the code may terminate 
        early, so make sure not to mess up.)</p>
    <p>Functions are typically written to do a specific job or perform some useful action. 
        A function named <span class="highlightbox"><b>max</b></span> might have a statement that 
        figures out which number is larger.</p>
    <p>A function called <span class="highlightbox"><b>calculateGrade</b></span> may calculate a student's grade from tests, quizzes, or homework. 
        A function named <span class="highlightbox"><b>printEmployee</b></span> might print stored information on an employee to the console. Remember, functions 
        are used as a common organizational tool.</p>
    <div class="nomenclature"><h1>Nomenclature</h1><p>When discussing functions, it's fairly common shorthand to append a pair of parentheses to the end of 
        a function's name. For example, if you see <span class="highlightbox"><b>main()</b></span> or <span class="highlightbox"><b>doSomething()</b></span> , these are shorthand 
        functions named <span class="highlightbox"><b>main</b></span> 
        or <span class="highlightbox"><b>doSomething</b></span>.</p></div>
        
    <h1 id="hello-world">Hello World:</h1>
    <p>Now that you have a decent, brief understanding of what statements and functions are in C++, 
        let's go to the Hello, World! program and take a high-level look at what it does.</p>
    <div class="code">
  <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}</pre>
</div>
      <p>Line 1 is a special line called a preprocessor directive. This <span class="highlightbox"><b>#include</b></span> preprocessor directive indicates that we should use the contents 
          of the <span class="highlightbox"><b>iostream</b></span> library, which is part of the C++ standard library. <span class="highlightbox"><b>Iostream</b></span> allows us to read/write text to/from the console.</p>

      <p>We need this line in order to use <span class="highlightbox"><b>std::cout</b></span> on line 5. Excluding this would cause a compilation error on line 5, as the compiler 
          would not know what <span class="highlightbox"><b>std::cout</b></span> is because <span class="highlightbox"><b>iostream</b></span> is not included.</p>
      <p>Line 2 is blank and will not be compiled by the compiler, just like comments. The blank space serves to make it more readable for humans.</p>
      <p>Line 3 tells the compiler that we are going to write (define) whos name (identifier) and this function will produce an int(An Integer)</p>
      <p>Lines 4-7 tell the compiler which lines are part of the <span class="highlightbox"><b>main</b></span> function. Everything between the opening curly brace on 
          line 4 and the closing curly brace on line 7 is considered part of the <span class="highlightbox"><b>main function</b></span>. This is called the <span class="highlightbox"><b>function body</b></span>.</p>
      <p>Line 5 is the first statement within the <span class="highlightbox"><b>main function</b></span> and is the first statement that executes when we run the program. 
          <span class="highlightbox"><b>std::cout</b></span> (stands for <span class="highlightbox"><b>character output</b></span>) 
          and the <span class="highlightbox"><b><< operator</b></span> displays information in the console.</p>
      <p>Line 6 is a <span class="highlightbox"><b>return statement</b></span> that sends 0 to the Operating System (OS), signaling successful execution of the program. It’s the last 
          statement to run, completing the program.</p>
      <p>When you compile and run you will see <span class="highlightbox"><b>Hello, World!</b></span>in the console.</p>
      <h1 id="syntax-errors">Syntax and Syntax Errors:</h1>
      <p>In English, sentences are constructed according to grammatical rules that you learned in school. For example, normal sentences end with a period. 
          That is syntax. If there is no period, then that is a syntax error.</p>
      <p>C++ has syntax too, rules about how your program must be constructed in order to be considered valid by the compiler. The compiler is responsible 
          for making sure you follow the syntax of C++. If you have syntax errors, then the compiler will flag the line as a syntax error.</p>
      <p>Lets see what happens when we get rid of the semicolon on Line 5 of "Hello, World!"</p>
      <div class="code">
  <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
   std::cout << "Hello world!"
   return 0;
}</pre>
</div>
      <p>Your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Visual Studio Code will output an error:</p>
      <div class="code">
  <pre>c:\vcprojects\hello.cpp(6): error C2143: 
      syntax error : missing ';' before 'return'</pre>
</div>
      <p>The compiler reports an error on line 6, indicating a missing semicolon before the return statement. 
          This error might stem from line 5, where a semicolon is conventionally expected.</p>
      <p>Syntax errors are common when writing a program; fortunately, they're typically straightforward to fix, as the 
          compiler will tell you where the problem is. A program will never compile if a syntax error is present.</p>

      <h1 id="chapter1-2" class="chapter">Chapter 1.2: Comments</h1>
      <h1>Single-Line Comments</h1>
      <p>The <span class="highlightbox"><b>//</b></span> symbol begins a C++ single-line comment, which pretty much 
          tells the compiler to ignore everything 
          from the beginning of <span class="highlightbox"><b>//</b></span> to the end of the line.</p>
      <p>Typically, a single-line comment appears at the top of the file with your name, the date, and other personal information. 
          They are also used to describe the logic of a statement or an expression.</p>

      <h1>Multi-line Comments</h1>
      <p>Multi-line comments span multiple lines, starting with <span class="highlightbox"><b>/*</b></span> and ending with <span class="highlightbox"><b>*/</b></span>. 
          These are helpful for explaining longer sections of code.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div class="code">
  <pre>/* This is a multi-line comment.
   This line will be ignored.
   So will this one. */</pre>
</div>
       <p>Since everything is between the symbols is ignored, you will sometimes see
       programmers make the code more nice looking</p>
       <div class="code"><pre>/* This is a multi-line comment.
 * the matching asterisks to the left
 * can make this easier to read
 */</pre></div>
       <p>Multi-line comments cannot be nested, as it would cause a compile error</p>
       <div class="code"><pre/* This is a multi-line /* comment */ 
this is not inside the comment */
// The above comment ends at the first */, not the second */pre></div>
       <p>When the compiler tries to compile this, it will ignore everything from the first 
           <span class="highlightbox"><b>/* to the first /*</b></span>. Since this is <span class="highlightbox"><b>not inside the comment */</b></span> is not
       considered part of the comment, the compiler will try and result in a compile error.</p>
       <p>This one place where using a syntax highlighter can be useful, as the different color for the comment should
       make clear whats considered part of the comment and which one is not.</p>
