        <h1 id="chapter1-1" class="chapter">Chapter 1.1: Statements and structure of a program</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <h1>Statements:</h1>
    <p>A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tells the computer what to do.
        A statement is a type of instruction that tells the program to perform some action. 
        Statements are the most common type of instruction in a C++ program because they are the smallest 
        independent unit of computation in C++, so they function like sentences in natural language.    
    <p>When we talk or convey an idea 
        to another person, we typically speak or write in sentences, so in C++, we write in 
        statements instead. Almost all (not always) statements will 
        end in a semicolon. In C++, a single statement could compile into many Machine Language Instructions</p>
    <h1>The different types of statements:</h1>
    <p>• Declaration statements</p>
    <p>• Jump statements</p>
    <p>• Expression statements</p>
    <p>• Compound statements</p>
    <p>• Selection statements (conditionals)</p>
    <p>• Iteration statements (loops)</p>
    <p>• Try blocks</p>
    <h1>Functions and Main Functions:</h1>
    <p>In C++, statements are grouped into units called functions. 
        A function is a collection of statements executed 
        sequentially (in order). When you learn more, you will be able 
        to create some pretty awesome functions.</p>
    <div class="rule-box">
        <h1>Rule</h1>
        <p>Every function must have a special function named main (all lowercase). 
            When the program is compiled and run, the statements inside main are run 
            in sequential order.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Programs usually terminate after running after the last statement inside 
        the function main has been executed. (Though due to bugs or mistakes, the code may terminate 
        early, so make sure not to mess up.)</p>
    <p>Functions are typically written to do a specific job or perform some useful action. 
        A function named <span class="highlightbox"><b>max</b></span> might have a statement that 
        figures out which number is larger.</p>
    <p>A function called <span class="highlightbox"><b>calculateGrade</b></span> may calculate a student's grade from tests, quizzes, or homework. 
        A function named <span class="highlightbox"><b>printEmployee</b></span> might print stored information on an employee to the console. Remember, functions 
        are used as a common organizational tool.</p>
    <div class="nomenclature"><h1>Nomenclature</h1><p>When discussing functions, it's fairly common shorthand to append a pair of parentheses to the end of 
        a function's name. For example, if you see <span class="highlightbox"><b>main()</b></span> or <span class="highlightbox"><b>doSomething()</b></span> , these are shorthand 
        functions named <span class="highlightbox"><b>main</b></span> 
        or <span class="highlightbox"><b>doSomething</b></span>.</p></div>
        
    <h1 id="hello-world">Hello World:</h1>
    <p>Now that you have a decent, brief understanding of what statements and functions are in C++, 
        let's go to the Hello, World! program and take a high-level look at what it does.</p>
    <pre class="code">
    <code class="cpp"></code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
int main() {
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
      <p>Line 1 is a special line called a preprocessor directive. This <span class="highlightbox"><b>#include</b></span> preprocessor directive indicates that we should use the contents 
          of the <span class="highlightbox"><b>iostream</b></span> library, which is part of the C++ standard library. <span class="highlightbox"><b>Iostream</b></span> allows us to read/write text to/from the console.</p>

      <p>We need this line in order to use <span class="highlightbox"><b>std::cout</b></span> on line 5. Excluding this would cause a compilation error on line 5, as the compiler 
          would not know what <span class="highlightbox"><b>std::cout</b></span> is because <span class="highlightbox"><b>iostream</b></span> is not included.</p>
      <p>Line 2 is blank and will not be compiled by the compiler, just like comments. The blank space serves to make it more readable for humans.</p>
      <p>Line 3 tells the compiler that we are going to write (define) whos name (identifier) and this function will produce an int(An Integer)</p>
      <p>Lines 4-7 tell the compiler which lines are part of the <span class="highlightbox"><b>main</b></span> function. Everything between the opening curly brace on 
          line 4 and the closing curly brace on line 7 is considered part of the <span class="highlightbox"><b>main function</b></span>. This is called the <span class="highlightbox"><b>function body</b></span>.</p>
      <p>Line 5 is the first statement within the <span class="highlightbox"><b>main function</b></span> and is the first statement that executes when we run the program. 
          <span class="highlightbox"><b>std::cout</b></span> (stands for <span class="highlightbox"><b>character output</b></span>) 
          and the <span class="highlightbox"><b><< operator</b></span> displays information in the console.</p>
      <p>Line 6 is a <span class="highlightbox"><b>return statement</b></span> that sends 0 to the Operating System (OS), signaling successful execution of the program. It’s the last 
          statement to run, completing the program.</p>
      <p>When you compile and run you will see <span class="highlightbox"><b>Hello, World!</b></span>in the console.</p>
      <h1 id="syntax-errors">Syntax and Syntax Errors:</h1>
      <p>In English, sentences are constructed according to grammatical rules that you learned in school. For example, normal sentences end with a period. 
          That is syntax. If there is no period, then that is a syntax error.</p>
      <p>C++ has syntax too, rules about how your program must be constructed in order to be considered valid by the compiler. The compiler is responsible 
          for making sure you follow the syntax of C++. If you have syntax errors, then the compiler will flag the line as a syntax error.</p>
      <p>Lets see what happens when we get rid of the semicolon on Line 5 of "Hello, World!"</p>
      <div class="code">
  <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
   std::cout << "Hello world!"
   return 0;
}</pre>
</div>
      <p>Your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Visual Studio Code will output an error:</p>
      <div class="code">
  <pre>c:\vcprojects\hello.cpp(6): error C2143: 
      syntax error : missing ';' before 'return'</pre>
</div>
      <p>The compiler reports an error on line 6, indicating a missing semicolon before the return statement. 
          This error might stem from line 5, where a semicolon is conventionally expected.</p>
      <p>Syntax errors are common when writing a program; fortunately, they're typically straightforward to fix, as the 
          compiler will tell you where the problem is. A program will never compile if a syntax error is present.</p>

      <hr>
        <h1 id="chapter1-2" class="chapter">Chapter 1.2: Comments</h1>
      <hr>
      
      <h1>Single-Line Comments</h1>
      <p>The <span class="highlightbox"><b>//</b></span> symbol begins a C++ single-line comment, which pretty much 
          tells the compiler to ignore everything 
          from the beginning of <span class="highlightbox"><b>//</b></span> to the end of the line.</p>
      <p>Typically, a single-line comment appears at the top of the file with your name, the date, and other personal information. 
          They are also used to describe the logic of a statement or an expression.</p>

      <h1>Multi-line Comments</h1>
      <p>Multi-line comments span multiple lines, starting with <span class="highlightbox"><b>/*</b></span> and ending with <span class="highlightbox"><b>*/</b></span>. 
          These are helpful for explaining longer sections of code.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div class="code">
  <pre>/* This is a multi-line comment.
   This line will be ignored.
   So will this one. */</pre>
</div>
       <p>Since everything is between the symbols is ignored, you will sometimes see
       programmers make the code more nice looking</p>
       <div class="code"><pre>/* This is a multi-line comment.
 * the matching asterisks to the left
 * can make this easier to read
 */</pre></div>
       <p>Multi-line comments cannot be nested, as it would cause a compile error</p>
       <div class="code"><pre>/* This is a multi-line /* comment */ 
this is not inside the comment */
// The above comment ends at the first */, not the second */<pre></div>
       <p>When the compiler tries to compile this, it will ignore everything from the first 
           <span class="highlightbox"><b>/* to the first /*</b></span>. Since this is <span class="highlightbox"><b>not inside the comment */</b></span> is not
       considered part of the comment, the compiler will try and result in a compile error.</p>
       <p>This one place where using a syntax highlighter can be useful, as the different color for the comment should
       make clear whats considered part of the comment and which one is not.</p>
       <div class="warning">
            <h1>Warning</h1>
            <p>Dont use multi-line comments inside other multi-line comments. Wrapping single-line comments
                inside a multi-line comment is okay.
            </p>
       </div>
       <div class="best-practice">
            <h1>Best Practice</h1>
            <p>Comment your code liberally, and write it like the person does not know what
                the code does. Dont assume youll remember you made specific choices.
            </p>
       </div>

              <h1 id="chapter1-3" class="chapter">Chapter 1.3: Introduction to Objects and Variables</h1>
           <hr>
           
       <p>A program can acquire data to work in many ways: from a file or database, over a network, from the user
        providing input on a keyboard, or from the programmer.
       </p>
       <p>A single peice of data is called a <span class="highlightbox"><b>value</b></span>. 
        Common examples of <span class="highlightbox"><b>value</b></span> includes 
        <span class="highlightbox"><b>letters</b></span>, 
        <span class="highlightbox"><b>numbers</b></span>, and 
        <span class="highlightbox"><b>text</b></span>.
       </p>

       <h1>Random Access Memory</h1>
       <p>The main memory in a computer is called 
        <span class="highlightbox"><b>Random Access Memory</b></span>. When we run a program, 
        the OS loads the program into ram, any data hardcoded will load like 
        <span class="highlightbox"><b>Hello, World!</b></span>
       </p>
       <p>The operating system reserves extra RAM for storing data during a program's runtime, 
        such as user input, file data, or calculations. RAM can be seen as numbered boxes holding values. In older languages like 
        Applesoft BASIC, programmers could directly access specific memory locations, while modern languages manage this automatically.</p>
        <h1>Objects and Variables</h1>
        <p>In C++, direct access memory is discouraged, instead we access memory indirectly through an object. 
            An <span class="highlightbox"><b>object</b></span> in a region of storage that can store a value, and has associated properties. 
        </p>
        <p>The compiler and operating system handle memory assignment for objects, so instead of specifying exact memory locations, 
            we can simply refer to objects to store and retrieve values. This allows us to focus on using 
            objects without worrying about their specific placement in memory. 
        </p>
        <p>Although objects in C++ can be unamed, more often we name our objects with a 
            <span class="highlightbox"><b>variable</b></span>.
        </p>
        <h1>Variable instantiation</h1>
        <p>In order to create a variable, we use a special declaration statement called a 
            <span class="highlightbox"><b>definition</b></span>.
        </p>
        <p>Heres an example of a variable named <span class="highlightbox"><b>x</b></span>:
        </p>

        <div class="code"><pre>int x; // define a variable named x, of type int<pre></div>

        <p>At compile time, when the compiler sees this statement it makes a note to itself that we are defining a variable,
            giving it the name <span class="highlightbox"><b>x</b></span> and specifying it as an <span class="highlightbox"><b>int</b></span>.
            From that point foward the compiler sees the identifer <span class="highlightbox"><b>x</b></span> as a variable.
        </p>
        <p>At <span class="highlightbox"><b>runtime</b></span>, a variable is <span class="highlightbox"><b>instantiated</b></span>, meaning it is created and assigned a memory address. 
            For example, if variable x is instantiated at memory location 140, the program will access that location whenever x is used. 
            An instantiated object is also called an <span class="highlightbox"><b>instance</b></span>.
        </p>

        <h1>Data Types</h1>
        <p>
            So far, we have covered that objects are regions of storage that can store a data value, a 
            <span class="highlightbox"><b>data type</b></span>, or also called a <span class="highlightbox"><b>type</b></span> 
            determines what kind of value the object will store.
        </p>

        <p>
            Integers are just one of many data types that C++ uses out of box, 
            here is an example of defining a variable using data type double:
        </p>
        <div class="code"><pre>double width; // define a variable named width, of type double</pre></div>
        <p>C++ also allows you to create your own custom types.
            For the beginning, well stick with integer variables because they are simple. 
            Soon we will learn <span class="highlightbox"><b>double</b></span>.
        </p>
        <h1>Defining multiple variables</h1>
        <p>It is possible to define multiple variables of the same type in a single statement by seperating names with a comma, 
            these two snippets will be pretty much the same:
        </p>

        <div class="code"><pre>int a;
int b;</pre></div>

        <p>is the same as:</p>

        <div class="code"><pre>int a, b;</pre></div>
        
        <p>When defining multiple variables this way, there are two 
            common mistakes that new programmers tend to make:
        </p>
        <p>The first mistake is giving each variable a type when defining a variable in sequence.</p>
        <div class="code"><pre>int a, int b; // wrong (compiler error)
int a, b; // correct</pre></div>
        <p>The second mistake is to try to define varables 
            of different types in the same statement, which is not allowed. 
            Variables of different types must be defined in seperate statements.
        </p>
        <div class="code"><pre>int a, double b; // wrong (compiler error)

int a; double b; // correct (but not recommended)
// correct and recommended (easier to read)
int a;
double b;</pre></div>

<div class="best-practice">
    <h1>Best practice</h1>
    <p>
        Although the language allows you to do so, avoid defining multiple 
        variables of the same type in a single statement. Instead, define each variable in a 
        seperate statement on its own line.
    </p>
</div>
    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>In C++ we use objects to access memory. A named object is called a variable. 
        Variables have an identifier, a type, and a value. A variables type is used to determine how 
        the value in memory should be interpreted
</div>

              <h1 id="chapter1-4" class="chapter">Chapter 1.4:Variable assignment and initialization</h1>
            <hr>
            <h1>Variable assignment</h1>
            <p>After a variable has been defined, it ca be given a value 
                using the <span class="highlightbox"><b>=</b></span> operator. This process is called 
                <span class="highlightbox"><b>assignment</b></span>, and the <span class="highlightbox"><b>=</b></span> operator is called an 
                <span class="highlightbox"><b>assignment operator</b></span>.
            </p>

            <div class="code"><pre>int width; // define an integer variable named width
width = 5; // assignment of value 5 into variable width
                
// variable width now has value 5</pre></div>

            <p>By default, assignment copies the value on the right-hand side of the <span class="highlightbox"><b>=</b></span> operator, 
                the variable on the left-hand side of the operator. This is called a <span class="highlightbox"><b>copy assignment</b></span>.
            </p>
            <p>Heres an example where we use the assignment twice:</p>
            <div class="code"><pre>#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int width;
    width = 5; // copy assignment of value 5 into variable width
                
    std::cout << width; // prints 5
                
    width = 7; // change value stored in variable width to 7
                
    std::cout << width; // prints 7
                
    return 0;
}</pre></div>
            <p>This prints:</p>
            <div class="code"><pre>57</pre></div>
            <p>When we assign value 7 to variable width, the value 5 that 
                was there, is overwritten. Normal variables only hold one value at a time.
            </p>
            <div class="warning">
                <h1>Warning</h1>
                <p>
                    One of the most common mistakes that new programmers make is 
                    to confuse the assignment operator <span class="highlightbox"><b>=</b></span> with 
                    the equality operator <span class="highlightbox"><b>==</b></span>. Assignment 
                    <span class="highlightbox"><b>=</b></span> is used to assign a value to a variable. 
                    Equality <span class="highlightbox"><b>==</b></span> is used to compare two values.
                </p>
            </div>
                <h1>Variable initialization</h1>
                <p>
                    Assigning a value to a newly defined object requires two statements: one for definition 
                    and one for assignment. This can be simplified through initialization, where an initial value is provided 
                    during definition using a syntax called an initializer.
                </p>

                <div class="code"><pre>int width { 5 }; // define variable width and initialize with initial value 5

// variable width now has value 5</pre></div>

                <p>In the above initialization of variable width, { 5 } is the initializer, 
                    and 5 is the initial value.
                </p>
                <h1>Different forms of initialization</h1>
                <p>Unlike assignment, initialization in C++ is complex and difficult, 
                    so we will provide a simplified view to get started
                </p>

                <div class="code"><pre>int a;         // default-initialization (no initializer)

// Traditional initialization forms:
int b = 5;     // copy-initialization (initial value after equals sign)
int c ( 6 );   // direct-initialization (initial value in parenthesis)
                    
// Modern initialization forms (preferred):
int d { 7 };   // direct-list initialization (initial value in braces)
int f {};      // value-initialization (empty braces)</pre></div>

                <h1>Default-initialization</h1>
                <p>
                    When no initializer is provided, the <span class="highlightbox"><b>default-initialization</b></span> is used. In most cases, 
                    default-initialization performs no initialization and leaves the variable a indeterminate value
                </p>
                <h1>Copy-initialization</h1>
                <p>
                    When an intial value is provided after an equal sign, the 
                    <span class="highlightbox"><b>__copy-initialization</b></span>. This form is was from C language.
                </p>
                <div class="code"><pre>int width = 5; // copy-initialization of value 5 into variable width</pre></div>
                <p>Much like copy-assignment, copy-initialization copies the value on the right-hand side of the equals into the variable being 
                    created on the left-hand side. In the above snippet, variable <span class="highlightbox"><b>width</b></span> will be initialized with value 
                    <span class="highlightbox"><b>5</b></span>.
                </p>
                <p>Copy-initialization has fallen out of favour in modern C++ due to being slower than other forms of initialization. However, C++17 remedied the 
                    bulk of the issues, and is regaining popularity.

                        Copy-initialization is also used whenever values are implicitly copied, such as when passing arguments to a function by value, returning from a 
                        function by value, or catching exceptions by value.
                    </p>

                <h1>Direct-initialization</h1>
                <p>
                    When an intial value is provided in parentheses, the 
                    <span class="highlightbox"><b>direct-initialization</b></span> is used.
                </p>
                <div class="code"><pre>int width ( 5 ); // direct-initialization of value 5 into variable width</pre></div>
